      <description>What is marabunta? From its definition, marabunta is one of the names given to army ants.
The idea of the project is to create something similar applying, following nature knowledge and patterns using a client-server topology aiming to create a distributed task manager using gRPC at is core with an HTTP REST management interface.
 Think about it as if your whole infrastructure nodes where a bunch of ants at your command in where you could do distributed tasks using all your nodes at once, in a defined group or in a single node, keeping track of each task result and output.</description>
