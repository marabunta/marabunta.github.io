      <description>Cloud Backup Having to backup one, two or 10 systems is doable, but whey you need to backup hundreds and change frequently or temporally the credentials, bucket names etc things become complicated to manage.
One of the goals is to dynamically take advantage of the task payload in where the database credential could be passed, same as S3 access key etc, simplifying and securing with this the backup process at any scale.</description>

      <description>The big picture Tasks are stored in a MySQL, a worker (scheduler) periodically check the schedules and creates, updates or remove tasks from a live queue that uses redis, rabbitmq, nats, etc as a backend. One or more clients consume the queue and via a bidirectional gRPC stream dispatch the task to the proper client, if the task is finished, the client updates the result/status via gRPC Unary if not task is re-queued.</description>

      <description>What is marabunta? From its definition, marabunta is one of the names given to army ants.
The idea of the project is to create something similar applying, following nature knowledge and patterns using a client-server topology aiming to create a distributed task manager using gRPC at is core with an HTTP REST management interface.
 Think about it as if your whole infrastructure nodes where a bunch of ants at your command in where you could do distributed tasks using all your nodes at once, in a defined group or in a single node, keeping track of each task result and output.</description>
