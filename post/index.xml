      <description>In a nutshell. The task life cycle could be summarized in the following steps:
 A task is submitted via an HTTP API The task will be stored in a database (MySQL) for keeping track of it Based on the schedule, when is time to run it will be moved to a Redis queue The task is dispatched via gRPC to the targets The status of the task will be updated in the database  The process is pretty straightforward one of the main design goals is to avoid unnecessary complexity, giving priority to performance and simple orchestration of the tasks at all cost as for the maintenance and scalability of the full system.</description>

      <description>There are many good tools, frameworks offering multiple solutions for managing jobs, tasks, queues, etc, many of them are listed here http://queues.io/.
Technology changes and with this, new tools emerge. Days back you could be using gearman, these days probably nats.io or even ansible ad-hoc:
$ ansible all -a &amp;quot;ping -c3 1.1.1.1&amp;quot; -u devops --become  Just as an example that with multiple technologies the same result can be achieved, some relatively easy, others faster, etc.</description>

      <description>The big picture Tasks are stored in a MySQL, a worker (scheduler) periodically check the schedules and creates, updates or remove tasks from a live queue that uses redis, rabbitmq, nats, etc as a backend. One or more clients consume the queue and via a bidirectional gRPC stream dispatch the task to the proper client, if the task is finished, the client updates the result/status via gRPC Unary if not task is re-queued.</description>
